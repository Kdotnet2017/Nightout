# Nightout
Our proposal is to create a website to help a user plan their night out. To that end, it uses the Ticketmaster API and the Google Places 

API to show a user a list of 25 events by location and/or keyword, purchase tickets to that event, and then show them restaurants/bars 

near the venue and those establishments locations. Currently going to use Pure CSS for styling.
